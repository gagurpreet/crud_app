## Planning and Problem Solving
I created mind map to brainstrom the functionality of my application and the logic behind the visual look.
I created a list to add functions for user account.
Once I finished with my list of requirements for my plan then I did bit of research how will I add features.
I also, created the plan for my database schema as well as what user information I would consider and what information I will display.
I created the whole project with itrative approach and setting smaller milestones.
